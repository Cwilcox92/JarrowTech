Technical Interview
=====
Thanks for sitting down to do the technical interview for JarrowTech! We're happy to see your interest in the company and are looking forward to seeing your technical skills.

This interview will ask you to put together a react-native application to various specifications, following our given style guides. Please complete all tasks as completely and accurately as possible. We are looking to assess the quality, style, and structure of your code more than the end result.

Your first task is to read through the style guide. Your code must meet these style requirements for us to proceed with the interview process.

 1. Set up a basic react native project.
 2. Install the `react-navigation` framework.
 3. You are going to build a "Fruit Facts" app. When the app initially loads, a home screen should display. A number of buttons should give you the ability to choose between several different fruits. When a fruit is selected, divert to another page that displays a picture of the fruit and a fact about your fruit. (These can be as simple or ridiculous as you desire.)
 4. Add another button to the main screen that lets you choose 'apples' Then create an apples page that directs to several other types of apples.
 5. Ensure that there are at least 2 types of apples, and 2 fruits besides apples present within the app. If you're having trouble coming up with "fun facts" about the fruit, I would either list their price or their color.

Finally, upload your code to a public github repository and share a link to it with your contact at JarrowTech.

Of course, you could spend days on this task, but we ask you to limit your work to three hours or less. You are free to use the internet as much as you like, borrow as much code from stack overflow as you deem appropriate, and otherwise perform your coding as you normally would. You are not expected to be able to finish all 5 segments, and we ask that you simply submit as much as you are able to get done within the 3 hour window.

Then, open an issue in the github repo. Within the body of that issue, please list 1 thing you are especially proud of about your code and 2 things that were challenging and how you overcame that issue.

Thank you so much for your interview with JarrowTech, and we will be in contact shortly after receiving your submission!
