## Fisher Innovation Launchpad Information
The Fisher Innovation Challenge launched in  2016 as a way to catalyze Wyoming technology start-up businesses. The Fisher Challenges are supported by a generous financial gift from Mr. Donne Fisher, which was matched by the University of Wyoming Office of Research and Economic Development. In 2018, the Fisher Innovation Challenge seed fund increased to $125,000 then, in 2019, it was renamed to the Fisher Innovation Launchpad.
